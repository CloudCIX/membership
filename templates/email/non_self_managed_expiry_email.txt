Dear {{ admin.first_name }} {{ admin.surname }},

You are receiving this email because {{ member.name }} manages other Members where some Users will soon expire.
{% for user in users %}
      {{ user.member.name }}: {{ user.first_name }} {{ user.surname }} - {{ user.email }}
{% endfor %}
Once an account has expired, a User will not be able to use any CloudCIX service, and they will not receive any notifications from CloudCIX.
In order to update the User please:
  Log into the CloudCIX portal
  Click My Partners from the side bar
  Click Linked Members
  Click on Users from the Member's dropdown menu
  Go to Expiry Date and set for a date in the future
  Click Update in the top right hand corner
  The User is now successfully updated and no further action is required

Please do not hesitate to contact us if you have any difficulty or questions. Our contact details can be found at https://www.cloudcix.com/#/support
